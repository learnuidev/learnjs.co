  "blueprint.why.title": "Start with WHY?",
  "blueprint.why.content.one": "Before we start teaching any concept, we always start with this fundamental question: WHY? Why do we need to learn it? Asking this allows us to establish the right context.",

  "blueprint.why.content.two": "As a result, you will be better prepared and motivated for the actual learning material. If we don't know why we are learning, then it's very easy to forget or even fail to appreciate why we are learning it.",

  "blueprint.practical.title": "Short, Practical, Based on Real-World Codebase",
  "blueprint.practical.content.one": "We focus on short, practical lessons that are based on real-world codebases.",
  "blueprint.practical.content.two": "This approach ensures that you learn applicable skills that are immediately useful in actual development scenarios.",
  "blueprint.practical.content.three": "By grounding our lessons in real-world examples, we make the learning process more relevant and engaging.",

  "blueprint.learning-path.title": "Flexible Learning Path",
  "blueprint.learning-path.content.one": "Each lesson is self-contained, meaning it doesn't depend on any others.",
