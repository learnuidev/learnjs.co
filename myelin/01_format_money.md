# Formatting Money

You are given a monetary value (e.g., 1000), and you need to display this value in different formats based on the user's location. For example:

If the location is Europe, format the value as euros (e.g., €1,000.00).

If the location is the US, format the value as US dollars (e.g., $1,000.00).

If the location is the UK, format the value as pounds (e.g., £1,000.00).

The solution should work for any country's currency format.

Format the given monetary value according to the user's location.
