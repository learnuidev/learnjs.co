          At learnjs.co our Blueprint is simple: Teaching Practical, Useful
          concepts based on Real World Examples.

          Before we start teaching any concept, we always start this fundamental
          question: WHY? Why do we need to learn it? Asking allows us to
          establish the right context. As a result you will be better prepping
          and motivated you for the actual learning material. If we dont know
          why we are learning, then its very easy to forget or even appreciate
          why we are learning it.

          Most JavaScript courses are long, boring, and frankly useless. If I
          had a dime for every time I saw examples such as x(), foo(), I would
          be richer than Ali Abdaal. All the examples use code from Real World
          Code Bases, which can be copy pasted right into your app. Which means,
          no more useless foo, bar and baz and shipping more useful code. More
          over all of our lessons are less than 5 minutes. This is by design.
          Study shows that the longer the content, the shorter the attention
          span is likely to be, as people tend to have a harder time focusing on
          information for extended periods.

          Each lesson is self contained, meaning it doesnt depend on any others.

          Whether you want to take the linear approach, or simply want to learn
          about specific concept, its up to YOU. You are incharge (and you
          should be) of your learning.
